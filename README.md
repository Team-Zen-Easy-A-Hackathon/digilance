# Digilance

## Introduction

Digilance is a blockchain-based online marketplace for freelance services. The platform connects freelancers with clients, ensuring that the work produced meets requirements through a validation system. The validation process involves topic-specific randomized community validators with proven experience.

## Installation Guide

Clone the project repository and follow the steps below to install and run the project:

1. Add the MetaMask web extension to your browser.
2. After setting up MetaMask, navigate to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the following command to start the project:

### `npm start`

5. The application will run in development mode.
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.
7. Ensure that MetaMask is active and logged in to the desired wallet account.



## Technical Guide

Digilance incorporates various technical components to enhance security, efficiency, and transparency within the platform:

1. Authentication System: Digilance uses a digital wallet-based authentication system, leveraging the MetaMask extension for quick login. This improves security and provides instant access to the wallet without additional wallet IDs.

2. Project Publication and Developer Ranking: Projects are published on a community page, allowing clients to choose developers based on their experience level. Developer ranking increases with successful bids.

3. Proof of Work (PoW): Code/project validators perform proof of work during the final project handover. Validators, randomly selected from relevant industry groups, verify task completion based on the provided descriptions. This adds an additional check and mitigates client-side issues.

4. Task Validation and Consensus: Digilance utilizes a consensus mechanism that requires 100% task validation by validators. Validators are chosen randomly within specific industry groups, ensuring fairness. Developers have equal opportunities to become validators.

5. Validation Rewarding System: Each bid includes a fee locked for validators. A validation rewarding system releases smart contract funds to developers and validators upon project validation by the client.
